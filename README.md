#  Mac Inkball

A  work in progress clone of Microsoft InkBall for macOS.

InkBall was originally shipped with Windows XP tablet computers which featured stylus input. 
The user draws ink using the stylus or mouse to guide coloured balls into the corresponding  coloured goals.

The primary Input method uses the normalised position of a single touch and touch moved/drag gesture on an Apple trackpad. the position is then remapped to the view coordinates and provides the points for a CGPath representing the ink.

Traditional mouse input is to follow.

Experiential switch, joystick and keyboard control is to be explored. 

A level editor is also included.
